"""
Complex model that combines 3D Lp-pooling, 2D batch normalization, and 1D dropout.
The model ingests a 5D tensor (N, C, D, H, W), reduces its spatial footprint with LPPool3d,
collapses dimensions to apply BatchNorm2d, applies channel dropout (Dropout1d), and finally
projects to a smaller feature vector per sample.
