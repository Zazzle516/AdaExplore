class Model(nn.Module):
    """
    Complex vision-inspired module that combines convolutional processing,
    synchronized batch normalization, and two different nonlinearities
    (HardTanh and Softsign) to produce a residual-style feature transform.

    The forward pass:
    1. Applies a 3x3 convolution to expand channels.
    2. Applies SyncBatchNorm to stabilize statistics across devices.
    3. Applies HardTanh nonlinearity (clamped activation).
    4. Computes a channel-wise descriptor via spatial global average.
    5. Applies Softsign to the descriptor and uses it to modulate features
       (like a lightweight channel attention).
    6. Projects back to the original channel count with a 1x1 convolution.
    7. Adds a residual connection and applies a final Softsign for bounded output.
