    Complex image-to-vector module that combines replication padding,

    learned scaling to produce a compact representation.

    Pipeline:
    1. ReplicationPad2d to expand spatial context.
    2. AdaptiveMaxPool2d to produce a small fixed spatial grid.
    3. Reshape to sequence and apply InstanceNorm1d (per-instance, per-channel).
    4. Learnable channel-wise scale and bias applied across the sequence.
    5. Non-linearity (LeakyReLU).
    6. Two spatial summarizations (mean and max) across the sequence, concatenated
       to produce the final feature vector of size 2 * channels.
