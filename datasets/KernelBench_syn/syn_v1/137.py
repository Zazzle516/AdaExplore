    """
    A moderately complex module that demonstrates a 3D-to-2D pooling + channel fusion pattern,
    followed by spatial-pointwise projection using LazyLinear and a small global residual path.

    Computation summary:
    - AdaptiveAvgPool3d reduces spatial/temporal resolution to a fixed (D', H', W')
    - Depth dimension is folded into channels to produce a (N, C * D', H', W') tensor
    - nn.Dropout2d randomly drops entire channels (works on the combined channels)
    - The tensor is rearranged so each spatial location is a separate vector and passed through
      an nn.LazyLinear layer (in_features inferred on first forward) to produce per-location embeddings
    - Per-location embeddings are averaged to produce a global feature vector (N, out_features)
    - A small residual branch computes a global channel-wise average of the original input and
      projects it to out_features using a standard nn.Linear
    - The two paths are combined and normalized with LayerNorm
