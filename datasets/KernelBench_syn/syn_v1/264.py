"""
Complex example combining a TransformerDecoderLayer with a 3D transposed convolution
and a final Softmax over channels. The model processes a sequence of embeddings
(with length equal to depth*height*width), refines them with a Transformer decoder
(using a projected version of the sequence as "memory"), projects the sequence to
3D feature maps, upsamples / decodes them with ConvTranspose3d, and produces a
channel-normalized output via Softmax.

Structure:
- Model(nn.Module)
  - __init__: constructs TransformerDecoderLayer, projection layers, ConvTranspose3d, activations.
  - forward: applies the described pipeline.
- get_inputs(): returns a random input tensor shaped (batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)
- get_init_inputs(): returns the initialization parameters for the Model constructor

Configuration variables are defined at module level for easy adjustments.
