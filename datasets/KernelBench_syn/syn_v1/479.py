    Patch-aware channel gating model.

    This model demonstrates a combination of nn.Unfold to extract local patches,
    a learned linear projection on each patch to produce channel logits,
    nn.LogSoftmax to produce stabilized log-probabilities over channels for each patch,
    and nn.Dropout3d to randomly drop entire channels before applying a
    channel-wise gating computed from the patch statistics.

    Forward pass summary:
    1. Extract patches from input using Unfold -> (B, C * K * K, L)
    2. Project each patch vector to per-channel logits -> (B, L, C)
    3. Convert logits to log-probabilities over channels (LogSoftmax)
    4. Average the per-patch probabilities to obtain per-channel scores (B, C)
    5. Apply Dropout3d to the original input and multiply channel-wise by the scores
       (broadcasted over spatial dims) producing gated output of shape (B, C, H, W).
