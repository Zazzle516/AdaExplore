    """
    Complex model that demonstrates mixing 3D batch normalization, 2D Lp-pooling applied across
    depth slices, 1D replication padding along the width axis, and a channel projection via a linear layer.

    Computation steps:
      1. BatchNorm3d across (B, C, D, H, W)
      2. For each depth slice, treat slice as a 4D tensor (B*D, C, H, W) and apply LPPool2d
      3. For each pooled row, apply ReplicationPad1d along the width dimension, then reduce (mean) across width
      4. Project channel features with a Linear layer to a smaller channel dimension
      5. Reassemble to (B, C_out, D, H_pooled) and global-average across (D, H_pooled) to produce (B, C_out)
