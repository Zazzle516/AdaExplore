    """
    Complex example combining Hardshrink, AvgPool2d and LazyBatchNorm2d in a branching pattern.

    Computation pattern:
      1. Apply Hardshrink to suppress small activations (non-linear sparsification).
      2. Form a residual branch capturing the subtracted components: residual = x - hardshrink(x).
      3. Concatenate the processed and residual branches along the channel dimension.
      4. Apply 2D average pooling to reduce spatial resolution.
      5. Apply LazyBatchNorm2d (lazy initialization of channel count on first forward).
      6. Compute a lightweight channel descriptor (global spatial average) and use a tanh-based gating
         to reweight the normalized activations (channel-wise attention-like scaling).
    The model intentionally doubles channels via concatenation to exercise the lazy batch norm initialization.
