    """
    Complex 1D patch-aggregation model that:
    - Pads the input with replication padding
    - Extracts sliding local blocks using nn.Unfold (treating 1D as 2D with height=1)
    - Applies LogSigmoid non-linearity to each extracted patch element
    - Performs a learned weighted aggregation across the patch dimension per channel
    - Adds a per-channel bias and final non-linearity

    The module is intended for inputs of shape (batch_size, in_channels, length).
    The output has shape (batch_size, in_channels, output_length) where
    output_length depends on padding, kernel_size and stride.
