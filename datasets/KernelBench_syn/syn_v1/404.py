class Model(nn.Module):
    """
    Complex 1D upsampling module that uses a lazy transposed convolution followed by
    nonlinear gating. The module demonstrates:
      - LazyConvTranspose1d (in_channels inferred at first forward)
      - Hardtanh activation for clipping
      - Hardsigmoid used to create a channel-wise gate from global statistics
      - A learnable channel-wise scale parameter applied to the final pooled output

    Forward computation steps:
      1. Apply LazyConvTranspose1d to input (upsampling / transpose conv)
      2. Apply Hardtanh nonlinearity
      3. Compute channel-wise global average over time
      4. Produce a channel-wise gate via Hardsigmoid
      5. Modulate the conv output with the gate and reduce over time dimension
      6. Apply a learned channel-wise scaling factor and return (batch, out_channels)
