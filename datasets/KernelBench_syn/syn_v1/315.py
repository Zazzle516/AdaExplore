    """
    Complex convolutional head that demonstrates a sequence of spatial padding,
    convolution, channel-wise normalization via LayerNorm, FeatureAlphaDropout,
    global pooling and a final linear projection.

    The forward pass:
      1. Reflection pad the input spatially.
      2. 3x3 convolution to expand channels.
      3. Non-linear activation (GELU).
      4. Permute to apply LayerNorm over channels (LayerNorm expects channel last).
      5. Apply FeatureAlphaDropout for robust channel dropout.
      6. Permute back to channel-first.
      7. Global average pooling to (1,1).
      8. Flatten and final Linear projection.

    This design mixes padding, normalization, and structured channel dropout
    to produce a reusable feature extractor block.
