    """
    Complex 2D preprocessing module that:
      1. Applies reflection padding to preserve boundary information.
      2. Performs 2D average pooling to reduce spatial resolution.
      3. Spatially normalizes each channel (zero-mean, unit-variance with epsilon).
      4. Applies LogSoftmax across the channel dimension so each spatial location's channels
         form a log-probability distribution.

    This combination is useful for creating a stabilized, spatially-aware per-location
    categorical (log-probability) representation from dense feature maps.
