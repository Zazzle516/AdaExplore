    A composite 3D reconstruction and channel-gating module.

    The model expects as input:
      - pooled: result of a MaxPool3d operation (Tensor of shape [B, C, D', H', W'])
      - indices: pooling indices returned by F.max_pool3d with return_indices=True
      - output_size: the original size tuple for unpooling (e.g., x.size())

    Pipeline:
      1. MaxUnpool3d to approximate the original 3D spatial resolution.
      2. SiLU activation applied element-wise.
      3. Channel-wise global average pooling across (D, H, W) producing a channel descriptor.
      4. LogSigmoid applied to the descriptor to yield gating coefficients.
      5. Channel gating: scale the unpooled tensor by the descriptor (broadcasted over spatial dims).
