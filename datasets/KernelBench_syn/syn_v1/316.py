    Complex model combining PixelUnshuffle, a LazyConvTranspose3d (deconvolution in 3D),
    MaxPool3d (with indices), and MaxUnpool3d to reconstruct spatial structure.
    The pipeline:
      1. PixelUnshuffle reduces H/W and increases channels.
      2. Channels are reinterpreted as a depth dimension to create a 5D tensor.
      3. A LazyConvTranspose3d upsamples (mostly spatially) and changes channel count.
      4. MaxPool3d is applied (returning indices), then immediately inverted with MaxUnpool3d.
      5. The depth dimension is folded back into channels producing a 4D tensor which is L2-normalized.
