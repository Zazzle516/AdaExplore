    Complex model combining AdaptiveAvgPool3d, AdaptiveAvgPool2d, and GRUCell.

    The model ingests a 5D video-like tensor of shape (B, C, D, H, W).
    - First, an AdaptiveAvgPool3d reduces (D, H, W) to a coarser 3D grid (D_out, H3, W3).
    - For each temporal slice along D_out we apply an AdaptiveAvgPool2d to further reduce spatial resolution to (H2, W2).
    - Each pooled slice is flattened and fed into a GRUCell sequentially across the D_out dimension.
    - The final GRU hidden state is projected to an output vector.

    This creates a spatio-temporal pooling + recurrent processing pipeline.
