    """
    A composite model that demonstrates interplay between 3D pooling,
    2D upsampling, and lazy instance normalization. The model:
      1. Applies a 3D max pooling to reduce spatial + depth resolution.
      2. Collapses the pooled depth into the channel dimension to form a 4D tensor.
      3. Applies LazyInstanceNorm2d (lazy initialization based on channels).
      4. Activates with ReLU and upsamples spatially using bilinear interpolation.
      5. Restores a pseudo-5D layout (split channels back into channel and depth),
         collapses depth via averaging, and merges with the original depth-averaged input
         via a learned gating parameter.
    The model is intentionally designed to mix 3D and 2D operations and to exercise lazy
    initialization behavior.
