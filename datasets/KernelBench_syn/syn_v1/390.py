    """
    Complex module that combines channel-wise softmax gating, upsampling, and hardtanh clipping.
    
    Computation pattern:
      1. Project input channels to a higher-dimensional embedding with a 1x1 convolution.
      2. Compute a channel-wise softmax at each spatial location to act as an attention/gating map.
      3. Apply the gating to the projected features (element-wise multiplication).
      4. Upsample the gated features spatially.
      5. Compute a spatial summary (mean over channels), concatenate it as an extra channel.
      6. Project back to the original number of channels with a 1x1 convolution.
      7. Apply HardTanh activation to bound the outputs.
