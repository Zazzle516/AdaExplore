    """
    Complex 3D-to-2D processing module that:
    - Applies circular padding in 3D (depth, height, width)
    - Flattens the depth dimension into the batch to run a 2D convolution (LazyConv2d)
      which will infer in_channels on first forward
    - Applies a ReLU non-linearity followed by Softmax2d across channels at each spatial location
    - Restores the depth dimension and aggregates across depth with a mean
    - Normalizes the final 4D tensor with a Frobenius-like norm per sample

    This pattern demonstrates mixing a 3D padding primitive with 2D convolutional
    processing by reshaping the tensor layout, and uses both lazy initialization
    and spatial softmax in a nontrivial pipeline.
