"""
Complex 3D spatial-channel mixing module demonstrating:
- AlphaDropout
- LazyBatchNorm3d (lazy-initialized on first forward)
- Threshold activation
- Learned channel projection and learned spatial mixing via einsum operations

Structure matches provided examples:
- Model class inheriting from nn.Module
- __init__ with configurable parameters
- forward doing a sequence of operations
- get_inputs() producing sample inputs
- get_init_inputs() returning initialization parameters
- Module-level configuration variables
