"""
Complex 3D upsampling module combining ConvTranspose3d, InstanceNorm3d, and RReLU.

Structure:
- Two staged transposed convolutional upsampling blocks (each: ConvTranspose3d -> InstanceNorm3d -> RReLU)
- A projected skip connection (single ConvTranspose3d) that upsamples the input directly to the final spatial size
- Residual fusion (element-wise addition) between the staged path and the skip projection
- Final 1x1x1 ConvTranspose3d projection to desired output channels

    3D upsampling/residual module.

    The network takes a low-resolution 3D feature volume and upsamples it by a factor of 4
    (two ConvTranspose3d stages each with stride=2). A parallel transposed convolution
    projects and upsamples the original input directly to the same final spatial dimensions,
    and the two paths are fused with an element-wise residual addition. Normalization and
    randomized leaky ReLU activations are applied between layers.
