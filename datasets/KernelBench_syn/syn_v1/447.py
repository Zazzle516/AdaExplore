    Complex 3D-to-2D processing module that demonstrates:
      - 3D reflection padding
      - Adaptive 3D max pooling
      - Lazy transposed 2D convolution applied after reshaping a 3D tensor
      - Batch normalization and ReLU non-linearity
      - A final adaptive 3D pooling followed by depth-wise reduction to produce a 2D feature map

      1. Input: (B, C, D, H, W)

      3. AdaptiveMaxPool3d -> (B, C, D1, H1, W1)

      5. LazyConvTranspose2d (learns in_channels at first forward) + BatchNorm2d + ReLU
      6. Reshape back to 5D (B, outC, D1, H2, W2)
      7. AdaptiveMaxPool3d to reduce to (B, outC, D2, H3, W3)
      8. Reduce over depth (mean) -> final (B, outC, H3, W3)
