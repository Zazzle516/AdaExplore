    1D sequence processing module that demonstrates a small encoder-like pattern:
    - 1D convolution expands channels to 2*hidden for GLU gating
    - GLU splits & gates along the channel dimension
    - Tanh non-linearity applied to gated output
    - MaxPool1d (with indices) reduces temporal length
    - MaxUnpool1d restores temporal length using the saved indices
    - Residual connection between pre-pooled gated features and the unpooled result
    - Final 1x1 conv reduces channels to desired output, followed by global temporal average
    
    This model uses nn.GLU, nn.Tanh, and nn.MaxUnpool1d from the provided layer list.
