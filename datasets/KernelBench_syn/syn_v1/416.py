"""
Complex model that mixes temporal and channel information with normalization and gating.

Computation graph:
    1. X_norm = InstanceNorm1d(X)                    # normalize per-instance per-channel across time
    2. T = X_norm @ W_time                            # linear mix across time dimension
    3. C = permute(T) @ W_channel                     # linear mix across channels (performed on permuted tensor)
    4. G = C * sigmoid(C)                             # gating implemented via LogSigmoid for numerical stability
       (sigmoid(C) = exp(LogSigmoid(C)))
    5. G_ln = LayerNorm(G_permuted)                   # layer norm across channel dim
    6. out = G_ln_permuted + X_norm                   # residual connection back to original shape
