    A more complex 3D-processing module that:
    - Uses two parallel LazyConv3d branches (different receptive fields)
    - Applies SiLU activations per branch
    - Concatenates branch outputs along the channel dimension
    - Applies a 3D average pooling to reduce spatial resolution
    - Projects concatenated channels down with a 1x1 Conv3d
    - Applies SiLU, performs global spatial averaging, and applies a final linear projection
    This design showcases LazyConv3d, AvgPool3d, and SiLU in a small residual/aggregation pattern.
