    3D feature extractor that demonstrates a combination of ReflectionPad3d,

    pooling and a small classifier head.

    Computation graph (high-level):
      x -> ReflectionPad3d -> Conv3d -> BatchNorm3d -> ReLU6 -> MaxPool3d -> [Global AvgPool, Global MaxReduce]

    This design shows multi-stage 3D processing, spatial reduction, two different
    global aggregation strategies and a final projection, combining the specified
    layers in a coherent pipeline.
