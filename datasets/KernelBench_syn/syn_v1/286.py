    Complex image patch attention module that:
    - Uses PixelUnshuffle to decompose spatial resolution into channel bundles
    - Extracts overlapping patches (via F.unfold)
    - Computes channel-wise attention per patch using Softmax
    - Aggregates patches and reconstructs a low-resolution attention map via nn.Fold
    - Upsamples the attention map and applies it as a spatial-channel-aware gating to the original input

    This pattern combines nn.PixelUnshuffle, nn.Softmax, and nn.Fold with standard tensor ops.
