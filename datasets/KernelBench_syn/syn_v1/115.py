    Complex fusion module that processes a 1D sequence with a lazy-initialized Conv1d
    and a 2D image with circular padding + Conv2d. The image features are pooled
    and projected to produce channel-wise gates that modulate the sequence features.
    The model demonstrates usage of nn.LazyConv1d, nn.CircularPad2d and nn.LocalResponseNorm
    alongside standard Conv2d, AdaptiveAvgPool2d and Linear layers.

        Forward pass that fuses sequence and image modalities.

        Steps:
        1. Apply LazyConv1d to sequence + GELU activation.
        2. Apply LocalResponseNorm to stabilize across channels.
        3. Circular-pad the image, apply Conv2d + ReLU, then spatially pool to a single vector.
        4. Project image vector to produce channel-wise gates (sigmoid).
        5. Apply gates to the normalized sequence features and aggregate.
        6. Final linear projection.
