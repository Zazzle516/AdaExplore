"""
Complex PyTorch kernel module combining RNNCell, MaxUnpool3d, and AvgPool1d.

Computation pattern:
1. MaxPool3d with return_indices to obtain pooled features and indices.
2. Flatten pooled spatial dims and apply AvgPool1d to create a temporal sequence.
3. Process the sequence with an nn.RNNCell iteratively to produce a final hidden state.
4. Map the final hidden state to channel-wise modulation factors.
5. Modulate pooled features and reconstruct the original volume via MaxUnpool3d.

Module-level configuration variables are used so get_inputs() can create consistent tensors.
