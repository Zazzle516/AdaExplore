"""
Complex volume-to-feature reduction model that:
- Pads a 3D volumetric input (ZeroPad3d)
- Upsamples spatial dimensions with trilinear upsampling (nn.Upsample)
- Collapses the depth dimension into channels, applies 2D max pooling (nn.MaxPool2d)
- Restores the original channel/depth split and reduces across depth (mean)
This creates a non-trivial interplay between 3D and 2D ops and reshaping.
