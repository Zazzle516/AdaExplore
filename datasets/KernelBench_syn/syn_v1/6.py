    """
    Complex vision-processing module that combines PixelUnshuffle, GroupNorm,
    Dropout1d and learned projections to produce a compact feature vector per image.

    Pipeline:
    1. PixelUnshuffle to reduce spatial resolution while increasing channels.
    2. GroupNorm over the increased channels.
    3. ReLU activation.
    4. Spatial flattening and channel-wise Dropout1d.
    5. Global spatial pooling (mean) to get per-channel descriptors.
    6. Two learned linear projections:
       - A main projection from pooled channels to out_features.
       - A gating projection that produces per-channel gates applied back to spatial maps
         (demonstrates mixing of spatial and channel operations).
    7. The final output concatenates the main projection with a secondary summary (max-pooled
       gated-response) to form the returned feature vector.
