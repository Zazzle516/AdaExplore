    """
    Complex patch-based reconstruction model that:
    - Pads the input spatially with a constant value (ConstantPad2d)
    - Extracts sliding local blocks (Unfold)
    - Applies a Log-Sigmoid nonlinearity to each patch element (LogSigmoid)
    - Scales patch elements by a learned per-element factor
    - Reconstructs the spatial tensor from modified patches using Fold (Fold)
    - Normalizes overlapped contributions and crops to the original spatial size
    - Produces a compact per-channel descriptor by spatial averaging

    The model demonstrates a non-trivial pipeline combining padding, patch extraction,
    elementwise nonlinearities, learnable scaling, and patch reassembly.
