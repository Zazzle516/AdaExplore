        Forward pass combining normalization, non-linearity, channel dropout,

        Steps:
        1. Instance normalization per channel (lazy initialized).
        2. Mish activation.
        3. Dropout1d to zero out full channels across the sequence dimension.
        4. Compute channel-wise statistics (mean over sequence length) and build a
           per-channel gate via softmax across channels.
        5. Scale activations with (1 + gate) to preserve base magnitude while allowing
           emphasis on selected channels.
