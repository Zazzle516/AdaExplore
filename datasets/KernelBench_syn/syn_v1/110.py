    Complex 3D feature-transform module that demonstrates a multi-stage computation:
      1. FeatureAlphaDropout to stochastically mask entire features (channels).
      2. Adaptive average pooling to reduce spatial resolution.
      3. Two fully-connected projections (bottleneck) with ReLU non-linearity.
      4. Reshape and trilinear upsampling back to the original spatial resolution.
      5. Dropout3d to randomly zero whole channels after upsampling.
      6. Residual connection and final ReLU activation.

    This pattern combines dropout variants and activations in a channel-aware 3D pipeline
    and is functionally distinct from simple pooling, bmm, or single-activation examples.
