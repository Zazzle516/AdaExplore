    A composite module that demonstrates a temporal upsampling pipeline using:
      - ConvTranspose1d (temporal / 1D transposed convolution)
      - GroupNorm (channel-wise group normalization for 1D tensors)
      - Non-linear activation (GELU)
      - Conversion to 2D-like tensor and UpsamplingNearest2d to further upsample the temporal axis

    The forward pass:
      1. Applies ConvTranspose1d to double the temporal resolution (due to chosen stride/padding/output_padding).
      2. Normalizes channels with GroupNorm.
      3. Applies GELU activation.
      4. Adds a singleton spatial dimension to treat the 1D signal as a (H, W=1) image.
      5. Upsamples the "height" (temporal axis) with nearest-neighbor 2D upsampling.
      6. Collapses the singleton width dimension to return a (N, C, L_out) tensor.
