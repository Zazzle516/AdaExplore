    """
    Complex example combining a lazy 3D convolution with 2D pooling/unpooling and nearest-neighbor upsampling.
    The model:
      - Applies a LazyConv3d to the input (B, C_in, D, H, W) producing (B, C_out, D, H, W)
      - Collapses the channel dimension to produce a single-channel per-depth 2D map
      - Performs MaxPool2d with indices, then MaxUnpool2d to recover spatial locations
      - Applies nearest-neighbor upsampling on the unpooled maps to expand spatial resolution
      - Uses the upsampled map as an attention-like modulation on a nearest-neighbor upsampled conv feature map
    Returns a tensor of shape (B, C_out, D, H * up_scale, W * up_scale).
