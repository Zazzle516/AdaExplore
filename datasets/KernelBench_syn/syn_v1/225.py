    Complex example combining ReflectionPad2d, GLU gating, and LazyBatchNorm1d.
    The model:
      - Pads the input spatially using reflection padding.
      - Creates a paired channel tensor by rolling channels and concatenating.
      - Applies a GLU over the channel dimension to produce gated feature maps.
      - Performs global average pooling per channel and applies LazyBatchNorm1d
        (which is lazily initialized on first forward).
      - Uses the normalized pooled features to produce a sigmoid scale per channel,
        reweights the gated feature maps, and adds a simple residual/statistics term.
      - Returns a flattened vector with a final GELU nonlinearity.
    Input shape: (batch_size, in_channels, height, width)
    Output shape: (batch_size, in_channels * padded_height * padded_width)
