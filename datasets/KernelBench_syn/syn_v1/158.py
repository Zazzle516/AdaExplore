class Model(nn.Module):
    """
    Complex patch-transform model that:
    - Applies ReLU activation
    - Performs 2D max pooling to reduce spatial resolution
    - Extracts overlapping patches using unfold
    - Applies a learned linear transform to each patch (im2col style)
    - Reconstructs the spatial tensor using nn.Fold
    - Normalizes overlaps (averaging) and applies a final ReLU

    This model demonstrates a combination of nn.MaxPool2d, nn.ReLU and nn.Fold,
    and uses matrix multiplication on unfolded patches to implement a patch-wise
    linear operator that is then folded back to image space.
