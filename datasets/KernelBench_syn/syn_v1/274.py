class Model(nn.Module):
    """
    Complex multi-modal module that processes an image-like tensor with InstanceNorm2d,
    a convolution, and LocalResponseNorm, and concurrently processes a sequence with an RNN.
    The spatial features are pooled and fused with the RNN's last time-step output, then
    projected to a final prediction vector.

    Computation steps:
      1. InstanceNorm2d over image input
      2. 2D convolution (preserves spatial dims with padding)
      3. LocalResponseNorm for lateral inhibition-style normalization
      4. ReLU activation + AdaptiveAvgPool2d to produce per-batch feature vector
      5. RNN over sequence input (batch_first=True)
      6. Concatenate image and sequence embeddings
      7. Final linear projection (with optional LogSoftmax for stable outputs)
