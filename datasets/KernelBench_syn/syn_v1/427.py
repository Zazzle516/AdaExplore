    Patch-aggregation module that:
      - Applies reflection padding to the input image tensor,
      - Extracts 3x3 patches (sliding window),
      - Linearly mixes each patch across channels to produce new channel embeddings,
      - Applies Channel-wise Dropout (Dropout2d),
      - Applies a Threshold non-linearity,
      - Applies an external channel gate (per-sample, per-channel scaling).

    Forward Args:
        x (torch.Tensor): Input of shape (B, C_in, H, W)
        gate (torch.Tensor): Channel gating tensor of shape (B, C_out) or (B, C_out, 1, 1)
