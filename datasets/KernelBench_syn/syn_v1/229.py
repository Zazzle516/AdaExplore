    Complex example combining AdaptiveAvgPool2d, AdaptiveMaxPool1d, and RMSNorm.
    
    Computation pattern:
    1. Spatially downsample input with AdaptiveAvgPool2d to a fixed (pool_h, pool_w).
    2. Flatten the spatial dimensions into a 1D sequence per channel.
    3. Apply AdaptiveMaxPool1d to produce a fixed-length sequence (here equal to pool_h * pool_w).
    4. Permute and apply RMSNorm across channels for each sequence position.
    5. Aggregate global channel-wise context via mean over the sequence, pass through a small gating transform (Linear + tanh).
    6. Modulate the normalized sequence with the gating signal and reshape back to spatial form.
    7. Upsample back to the original spatial resolution using bilinear interpolation.
