    A moderately complex vision-to-vector module illustrating a mix of convolution,
    nearest-neighbor upsampling, sparsifying activation (Hardshrink), spatial pooling,
    and a dense projection with a final LogSigmoid.

    Computation pipeline:
      1. 2D convolution for local feature extraction
      2. ReLU nonlinearity
      3. Nearest-neighbor upsampling (spatial enlargement)
      4. Hardshrink to sparsify small activations
      5. Adaptive average pooling to a compact spatial representation
      6. Linear projection to a high-dimensional vector
      7. LogSigmoid applied elementwise to the output vector

    This is functionally distinct from simple elementwise activations or pure matmuls.
