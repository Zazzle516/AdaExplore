"""
Complex composite module combining GroupNorm, RMSNorm, and Mish activation with
a channel gating mechanism and residual connection. The model accepts a 4D image-like
tensor and a channel gating tensor, applies group normalization, uses a learned
1x1 convolution to mix channels, gates channels via an RMS-normalized vector, and
finally projects the resulting feature map to a compact per-sample representation.
