"""
Complex PyTorch kernel module combining:
- nn.LazyConvTranspose1d (lazy transposed convolution / upsampling)
- nn.Hardsigmoid activation
- nn.Fold to reconstruct overlapping 1D patches into a sequence

Structure follows examples:
- Model class inheriting from nn.Module
- get_inputs() returning runtime tensors
- get_init_inputs() returning initialization parameters (none needed here)

Computation pattern (forward):
1. Transposed convolution (upsample) with lazy in_channels inference
2. Hardsigmoid activation
3. Extract sliding 1D patches via tensor.unfold
4. Apply learnable per-channel-per-kernel weights to patches
5. Reconstruct overlapped sequence via nn.Fold
