"""
Complex PyTorch kernel module demonstrating:
- LazyConv1d (lazy channel initialization)
- RMSNorm for channel-wise normalization
- Softshrink activation
- Gated residual pattern with projection and element-wise modulation

Structure follows the examples:
- Model class inheriting from nn.Module
- get_inputs() to produce runtime inputs
- get_init_inputs() for init-time parameters
- Module-level configuration variables
