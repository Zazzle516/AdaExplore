    """
    Complex module combining PixelUnshuffle, MaxPool2d/MaxUnpool2d with indices,
    a Sigmoid non-linearity, and a 1x1 convolution to fuse channels.

    Computation pipeline:
    1. PixelUnshuffle: rearrange spatial -> channel (downscale spatial by factor r).
    2. MaxPool2d (with return_indices=True): spatial pooling that produces indices.
    3. Sigmoid activation on pooled features.
    4. MaxUnpool2d: invert the pooling using indices to restore the pre-pooled spatial size.
    5. 1x1 Conv2d: reduce expanded channels back to original input channel count.

    This creates an interesting interplay between spatial reorganization and pooling/unpooling
    while using a non-linear gating (Sigmoid) in the pooled domain.
