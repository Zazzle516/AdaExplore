    A composite model that demonstrates interaction between 3D convolutions (temporal/volumetric data)
    and 2D image features. The model:
      1. Applies a lazy 3D convolution to a (B, C_in, D, H, W) volume.
      2. Collapses the depth dimension with an average to produce a 2D feature map.
      3. Applies 2D average pooling to reduce spatial resolution.
      4. Upsamples the pooled features back with bilinear interpolation.
      5. Computes an attention map from a separate 2D image and gates the upsampled features.
      6. Adds a residual connection from the collapsed 2D features and performs L2 normalization across channels.
