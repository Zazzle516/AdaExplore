    Complex 3D feature gating module.

    This model accepts a 5D tensor (N, C, D, H, W), applies replication padding,
    computes global average and max pooled channel descriptors from the padded tensor,
    combines them into a gating vector which is passed through a learned linear
    projection and a Sigmoid to produce a channel-wise gate. The gate is applied
    to the original (unpadded) input and then a Threshold nonlinearity is used.
    Finally, spatial dimensions are summed to produce an (N, C) output.

    This pattern demonstrates the use of nn.ReplicationPad3d, nn.Sigmoid, and
    nn.Threshold combined with tensor reductions and a small learnable projection.
