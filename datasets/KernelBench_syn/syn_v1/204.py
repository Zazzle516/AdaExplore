class Model(nn.Module):
    """
    Complex multi-step module that demonstrates interplay between 2D padding,
    3D pooling, channel-wise dropout, and a learned per-channel projection.

    Input:
        x: Tensor of shape (BATCH, CHANNELS, DEPTH, HEIGHT, WIDTH)

    Computation overview:
        1. For each depth slice, apply replication padding in HxW via ReplicationPad2d.
           (We merge batch and depth into a single 4D batch dim to reuse ReplicationPad2d.)
        2. Restore to 5D and apply MaxPool3d across (D,H,W).
        3. Collapse spatial HxW into a sequence length L and apply Dropout1d to zero
           out entire channels for each (batch*depth) sample.
        4. Perform a learned channel projection (nn.Linear) applied to each spatial location.
        5. Aggregate across spatial positions (mean) to produce a per-(batch,depth,channel)
           descriptor, then permute to (batch, channel, depth) and apply a depth-wise softmax
           to emphasize depth-located features.
