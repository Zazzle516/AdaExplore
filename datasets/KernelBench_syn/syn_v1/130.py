    1D upsampling and gating module.

    This model performs the following high-level steps:
    - Uses a LazyConvTranspose1d to upsample the input sequence by a factor (stride=2).
      The lazy transpose conv infers its in_channels from the input tensor.
    - Applies SyncBatchNorm across the channel dimension for stabilization.
    - Applies a channel-wise PReLU nonlinearity.
    - Computes a lightweight channel attention (global pooling + two linear layers) which
      produces channel-wise gates that modulate the activations in a residual manner.

    The combination results in an upsampling block with learned channel-wise gating.
