    Complex 3D processing module that demonstrates a mix of nonlinearities and pooling.

    Computation pattern (high level):
    1. Apply Softsign activation to the input tensor.
    2. Compute a depth-wise gating signal by averaging across the depth dimension.
    3. Modulate the activated tensor by a sigmoid gating map (channel-aware).
    4. Apply Softshrink for denoising/sparsification.
    5. Perform 3D max pooling to reduce spatial resolution.
    6. Channel-wise L1 normalization and optional scaling.

    This module accepts initialization parameters to configure the MaxPool3d kernel,
    the Softshrink lambda threshold, and a final channel scaling factor.
