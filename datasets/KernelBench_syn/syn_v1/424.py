    """
    A composite 2D feature mixer that combines BatchNorm2d, channel-wise learned
    linear mixing (implemented with nn.Parameter + matmul), GroupNorm and ReLU,
    with a learned residual channel projection.

    The model workflow:
      1. BatchNorm2d + ReLU on input feature maps.
      2. Reshape to (B, H*W, C) and perform two learned channel projections
         (C -> mid -> out) using torch.matmul to mix channel information
         at each spatial location.
      3. Reshape back to (B, out, H, W).
      4. Apply GroupNorm over the output channels.
      5. Add a residual path computed by projecting the original input channels
         to out channels (per spatial location) using a learned skip projection.
      6. Final ReLU activation.

    This creates a spatially-preserving, fully-learned channel mixing block
    that is functionally distinct from simple convs or pure normalization layers.
