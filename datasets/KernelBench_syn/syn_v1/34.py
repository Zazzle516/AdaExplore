    Complex model that combines upsampling, batch normalization, channel dropout (FeatureAlphaDropout),
    spatial pooling and a learned channel projection. The model is designed to accept an input tensor X
    of shape (B, C, H, W) and optionally an external projection matrix P of shape (out_c, C) to
    override the internal projection weights.

    Computation pattern (forward):
    1. Upsample spatial dimensions using nearest-neighbor upsampling.
    2. Apply BatchNorm2d over channels.
    3. Apply ReLU nonlinearity.
    4. Apply FeatureAlphaDropout to randomly mask channels.
    5. Global average pool spatial dimensions to produce a (B, C) tensor.
    6. Apply a linear channel projection (either internal learned weight or external P).
    7. Apply sigmoid activation to produce final (B, out_c) outputs.
