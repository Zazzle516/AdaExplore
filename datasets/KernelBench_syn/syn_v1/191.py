    Model that combines a 3D transposed convolution, Softplus non-linearity,

    1. ConvTranspose3d to expand spatial/temporal dimensions.

    3. Collapse the depth dimension into the channel dimension to produce a 4D tensor.
    4. UpsamplingNearest2d to upsample height/width.
    5. Compute spatial global mean per-channel, pass through Softplus to ensure positivity,
       and scale feature maps channelwise by this factor.
