    """
    Complex module that combines 2D replication padding + unfolding-based patch projection,
    3D zero-padding with depth-reduction, spatial resizing, elementwise gating, and ReLU6.
    
    Computation steps:
    1. ReplicationPad2d on a 4D image tensor.
    2. Extract 3x3 patches via nn.Unfold and linearly project patch vectors.
    3. ZeroPad3d on a 5D volumetric tensor and reduce over depth using max.
    4. Spatially resize the depth-reduced map to match the projected 2D feature map.
    5. Use the resized single-channel spatial map as a gating mask applied to every channel.
    6. Apply ReLU6 and global average pooling to produce final per-batch feature vectors.
