    1D processing pipeline that demonstrates padding, convolution, pooling/unpooling,

      - Applies asymmetric zero-padding to the time dimension

      - Performs MaxPool1d (saving indices)
      - Applies LogSoftmax across channel dimension
      - Uses MaxUnpool1d to restore pooled resolution
      - Combines the unpooled signal with the convolutional features and crops to original length
