    """
    Complex 3D spatial refinement module that demonstrates a combination of
    replication padding, local smoothing (average pooling), residual extraction,
    constant padding and a global-local gating mechanism using Tanh.

    The forward pass performs:
      1. Replication pad the input to give boundary context.
      2. Compute a local average (smoothing) and form a residual (detail) by subtracting.
      3. Apply constant padding to the residual to expand receptive field for gating.
      4. Compute a global channel-wise statistic and add it back (broadcast) to create
         a combined feature map.
      5. Apply Tanh nonlinearity, then compute a channel gating factor and modulate
         the features.
      6. Return the refined tensor (same dims as the padded result) ready for further processing.
