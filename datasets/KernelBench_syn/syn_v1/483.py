    A moderately complex module that:
      - Uses PixelUnshuffle to reduce spatial resolution while increasing channels.
      - Centers each channel by subtracting its spatial mean.
      - Applies a clipped ReLU (ReLU6) non-linearity.
      - Projects per-pixel channel vectors using a LazyLinear (in_features inferred at first forward).
      - Applies a learned channel mixing matrix (provided as input) via einsum.
      - Adds a global residual derived from the spatial means projected into output channels.
      - Final non-linearity (ReLU6) applied to the sum.
    This combines spatial re-arrangement, channel-wise statistics, lazy-initialized linear layers,
    and an external channel mixing matrix to produce a transformed feature map.
