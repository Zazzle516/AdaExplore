    Complex model that mixes 3D max pooling, spatial padding, 1D channel dropout (on flattened spatial dims),

    1. MaxPool3d over (D, H, W)
    2. Reduce depth dimension by taking the maximum across the pooled depth (torch.max)
    3. Apply ConstantPad2d to pad spatial dimensions (H, W)
    4. Flatten spatial dims into a sequence and apply Dropout1d across channels/sequence
    5. Restore spatial shape and apply a 1x1 Conv2d to mix channel information
    6. Global average over spatial dims to produce final per-channel features
