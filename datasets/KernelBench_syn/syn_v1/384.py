    Complex image-processing style module that:
    - Applies PixelUnshuffle to reduce spatial resolution and increase channels.
    - Normalizes each instance with InstanceNorm2d.
    - Applies a non-linearity followed by LocalResponseNorm across channels.
    - Pools spatially to a vector and projects to an output embedding via a Linear layer.

    This creates a different computation pattern from simple activations or reductions by combining
    pixel reorganization with normalization across both spatial-instance and local-channel contexts.
