Complex 3D processing module that demonstrates a combination of:
- LazyBatchNorm3d for lazy channel-wise normalization
- LPPool3d for Lp pooling in 3D (D, H, W)
- Dropout2d applied cleverly across depth slices by reshaping
The model performs:
    input -> LazyBatchNorm3d -> LPPool3d -> Dropout2d (applied per depth-slice) -> ReLU
    -> Global spatial average (over D,H,W) -> channel-wise scaling using BatchNorm weight (if available)
Outputs a (batch_size, channels) tensor (per-channel pooled descriptors).
