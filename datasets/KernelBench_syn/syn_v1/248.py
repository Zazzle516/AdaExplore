"""
Complex PyTorch kernel module combining Conv2d, AdaptiveMaxPool2d, and Softmax.

Design:
- Two-stage convolutional transform (3x3 then 1x1) to build channel features.
- Adaptive max pooling to produce a compact channel descriptor.
- Softmax over channels to create a channel-wise attention vector.
- Channel-wise scaling of convolution output (attention gating).
- Residual projection of the input (1x1 conv) to match output channels and pooled spatial size.
- Final global average over spatial dims to produce a compact output per channel.

Module-level configuration variables are provided for easy adjustments.
