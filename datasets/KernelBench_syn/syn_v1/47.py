"""
Complex 3D feature processing module combining InstanceNorm3d, a low-rank channel
projection (two linear layers applied per spatial location), ReLU6 nonlinearity,
AlphaDropout, and a residual connection scaled by an external channel-wise vector.

Structure follows the example style:
- Model class inheriting from nn.Module
- forward method implementing the computation
- get_inputs() returning runtime tensors for forward
- get_init_inputs() returning constructor parameters
- module-level configuration variables

    Processes a 5D volumetric tensor (B, C, D, H, W) as follows:
      1. Instance normalization across channels per sample.
      2. For each spatial location, apply a low-rank channel projection:
         linear(C -> proj_rank) -> ReLU6 -> linear(proj_rank -> C)
