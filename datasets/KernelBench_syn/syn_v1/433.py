"""
Complex module that mixes 3D circular padding, randomized leaky ReLU activation,
and a transformation that leverages 1D adaptive average pooling across the
width dimension after folding depth and height into the channel axis.

The forward pass produces a per-channel log-probability vector (log-softmax)
for each batch element by:
  1. Circularly padding the 3D spatial input.
  2. Applying a randomized leaky ReLU (RReLU).
  3. Folding depth and height into an expanded channel axis and pooling the width
     dimension adaptively (AdaptiveAvgPool1d).
  4. Aggregating pooled statistics to produce per-channel gating values.
  5. Re-weighting global per-channel means by the gates and returning
     a log-softmax over channels.
