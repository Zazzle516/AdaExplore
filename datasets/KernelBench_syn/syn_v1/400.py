"""
Complex module that:
- Applies AdaptiveMaxPool2d to spatially compress the input
- Rearranges pooled spatial dimensions into a 1D sequence and processes it with ConvTranspose1d
- Applies a learned PReLU activation
- Reshapes back to a 2D spatial tensor and computes a sigmoid gating mask
- Blends the transformed features with a channel-reduced version of the original input via the gating mask
This creates a cross-dimensional mixing pattern (2D -> 1D -> 2D) and a spatial gating/residual fusion.
