    """
    Complex model that combines 2D convolutions, a lazy BatchNorm, and multi-head attention
    to process image-like inputs and produce classification logits.

    Computation steps (high-level):
    1. conv1 (3x3) + ReLU -> intermediate feature maps
    2. conv2 (1x1) -> per-location embeddings
    3. Flatten spatial dims to sequence and apply LazyBatchNorm1d over feature dim
       (batch*seq treated as the batch for normalization)
    4. MultiheadAttention over the spatial sequence (self-attention)
    5. Residual connection from step 2 embeddings to attention output
    6. conv3 (3x3) as a local feed-forward applied on the attention-refined features
    7. Global average pooling and final linear classifier
