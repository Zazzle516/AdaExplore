    Complex model combining SyncBatchNorm, ZeroPad2d and an LSTM to process spatial
    feature maps as sequences. The input is expected to be a 4D tensor (N, C, H, W).
    
    Computation steps:
      1. Channel-wise synchronization batch normalization (nn.SyncBatchNorm)
      2. Zero padding around spatial dimensions (nn.ZeroPad2d)
      3. Rearrange spatial locations into a sequence: (N, H*W, C)
      4. Process the sequence with an LSTM (batch_first=True)
      5. Use the last-layer hidden state, project with a linear layer to class logits
      6. Apply log_softmax to produce log-probabilities
