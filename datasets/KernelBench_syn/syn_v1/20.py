"""
Complex module that:
- Accepts a 5D input tensor (N, C_in, D, H, W)
- Applies 3D replication padding
- Flattens the depth dimension into channels to run a 2D transposed convolution (ConvTranspose2d)
- Reshapes the conv output back into a 5D tensor with a new channel/depth layout
- Applies 3D channel-wise dropout (Dropout3d)
- Performs a learned channel mixing via einsum with a provided projection matrix

This module demonstrates interplay between 3D padding/dropout and 2D transposed convolution
by temporarily folding/unfolding the depth dimension. All shapes are fixed by top-level
configuration so the ConvTranspose2d can be constructed deterministically.
