        Steps:

        2. Permute to (B, D, L) and apply ZeroPad1d to pad sequence length.
        3. Permute back to (B, L_padded, D) and apply LayerNorm over D.
        4. Project with a linear layer and apply a gated non-linearity: tanh(projected) * projected.
        5. Slice out the center (unpadded) portion to restore original sequence length.
        6. Add the scaled residual connection.
        7. Apply LogSoftmax across the embedding dimension and return.
