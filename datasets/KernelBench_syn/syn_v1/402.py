    Complex 3D-to-2D processing module that:
      1. Applies 3D replication padding to a 5D input (N, C, D, H, W).
      2. Treats each depth slice as an independent 4D image by reshaping to (N*D, C, H, W).
      3. Upsamples each slice using nearest-neighbor 2D upsampling.
      4. Applies Instance Normalization per-channel on the upsampled slices.
      5. Reassembles the depth dimension and reduces across depth with an average to produce a 4D output (N, C, H_out, W_out).

    This creates a pipeline that mixes 3D padding, slice-wise 2D operations, normalization and a depth-aggregation stage.
