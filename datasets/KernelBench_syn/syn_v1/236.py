    Patch-based Transformer module that:
    - Extracts non-overlapping patches from an image using nn.Unfold
    - Linearly projects patches to a d_model dimensional embedding
    - Adds learned positional embeddings
    - Processes the sequence of patch tokens with an nn.TransformerEncoder stack
    - Applies nn.PReLU non-linearity across the embedding channels
    - Decodes tokens back to patch pixels and reconstructs the image with nn.Fold
    - Adds a residual connection from the input image to the reconstructed output

    This creates a hybrid convolution/transformer pattern suitable for vision-style inputs.
