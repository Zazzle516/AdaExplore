    Complex model that combines BatchNorm2d, AvgPool2d and AdaptiveAvgPool1d
    to produce a compact per-channel representation with a small learned gating mechanism.

    Computation steps (high-level):
    1. BatchNorm2d over input channels
    2. ReLU activation
    3. 2x2 AvgPool2d to reduce spatial resolution
    4. Collapse spatial dimensions and apply AdaptiveAvgPool1d to produce a fixed-length
       per-channel feature vector
    5. Flatten per-channel features and pass through two linear layers with GELU nonlinearity
       to produce a per-channel gating vector
    6. Apply sigmoid gating to the projected features and combine with a global per-channel
       average to produce final per-channel outputs of shape (batch_size, channels)
