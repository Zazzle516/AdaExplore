    """
    Complex example combining LazyInstanceNorm3d, spatial upsampling (nearest neighbor)
    and LocalResponseNorm. The computation pipeline is as follows:

    1. Apply LazyInstanceNorm3d to a 5D input tensor (B, C, D, H, W).
       This normalizes each instance over spatial dims and channels once channels are known.
    2. Collapse the depth dimension by computing the mean across D -> (B, C, H, W).
    3. Upsample the resulting 4D tensor using nearest-neighbor interpolation.
    4. Apply LocalResponseNorm on the upsampled 4D tensor to introduce cross-channel normalization.
    5. Broadcast the normalized upsampled tensor back to a 5D tensor and use it to modulate
       the original instance-normalized input that has been resized to the same spatial resolution.
    6. Reduce across channels to produce a compact 4D output (B, D, H_up, W_up).

    This demonstrates reshaping/reshuffling between 4D/5D tensors, module reuse (upsampling applied
    to both collapsed and per-slice tensors), and integration of three provided layers.
