"""
Complex 3D feature gating module that:
- Applies adaptive 3D average pooling to compress spatial dimensions.
- Uses GELU non-linearity on the pooled features.
- Computes channel-wise descriptors via spatial averaging.
- Passes descriptors through a small MLP (channel mixing).
- Applies FeatureAlphaDropout on the descriptors for robust channel gating.
- Uses sigmoid gates to reweight the pooled feature maps and collapses channels
  to produce a single-channel volumetric output which is then upsampled
  back to the original input resolution.

Structure follows the examples:
- Model class inheriting from nn.Module with __init__ and forward.
- get_inputs() returns example input tensors.
- get_init_inputs() returns initialization parameters used by the Model.
- Configuration variables at module level.
