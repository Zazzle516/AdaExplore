    """
    Complex model that combines spatial average pooling, linear patch projection,
    a stack of Transformer encoder layers, and a reconstruction head that upsamples
    the transformer output back to the original spatial resolution.

    Execution flow:
      1. Input image tensor (B, C, H, W) is reduced to non-overlapping patches using AvgPool2d
         with kernel and stride equal to patch_size, producing (B, C, H_p, W_p).
      2. Patch features are rearranged to a sequence (B, S, C) where S = H_p * W_p.
      3. A linear projection maps per-patch C-dim features to an embedding dimension (embed_dim).
      4. Positional embeddings are added and the sequence is fed through a TransformerEncoder
         (num_layers of nn.TransformerEncoderLayer).
      5. The transformer outputs are projected to out_channels and reshaped to (B, out_channels, H_p, W_p).
      6. Result is upsampled back to (B, out_channels, H, W) using bilinear interpolation.
