    Complex module combining replication padding, Lp pooling and an Elman RNN applied over spatial locations.

    Pipeline:
      1. Replication padding (ReplicationPad2d)
      2. Lp pooling (LPPool2d) to reduce spatial resolution
      3. Reshape pooled spatial grid into a sequence of feature vectors (seq_len = H_out * W_out)
      4. Process the sequence with a single-layer RNN (nn.RNN)
      5. Project RNN outputs back to channel dimension via a linear layer
      6. Reshape back to spatial grid and add a residual connection from the pooled features

    Input:
      x: Tensor of shape (N, C, H, W)

    Output:
      Tensor of shape (N, C, H_out, W_out) where H_out and W_out are the spatial dims after pooling.
