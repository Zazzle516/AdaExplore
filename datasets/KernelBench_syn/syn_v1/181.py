    """
    Complex module that combines ZeroPad2d, Upsample and ReLU with a learnable 1x1 mixing
    and channel-wise gating derived from spatial global average pooling.

    Computation pipeline:
      1. Zero-pad the input spatially
      2. Upsample the padded tensor (bilinear)
      3. Apply a learnable 1x1 convolution (via conv2d with weight/bias parameters)
      4. Apply ReLU non-linearity
      5. Compute channel-wise gates from global spatial average and apply sigmoid
      6. Fuse gated activations with a residual-style scaled tanh of the pre-activation
