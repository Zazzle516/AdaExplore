    """
    Complex model combining 3D instance normalization, depth-to-plane reduction,
    reflection padding, channel-wise FeatureAlphaDropout and a final projection.

    Computation steps:
        1. Apply LazyInstanceNorm3d to the input volume X (N, C, D, H, W).
           This will lazily initialize num_features the first time it's called.
        2. Reduce the normalized volume along the depth dimension (D) by mean to get a 4D tensor (N, C, H, W).
        3. Apply ReflectionPad2d to pad spatial dimensions.
        4. Spatially global-average the padded tensor to produce per-channel descriptors (N, C).
        5. Apply FeatureAlphaDropout across channels to randomly mask channels.
        6. Project the channel descriptors through a provided weight matrix W (C, M) to get (N, M).
