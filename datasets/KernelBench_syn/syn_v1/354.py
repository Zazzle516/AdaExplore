    """
    Complex model combining spatial centering, 2D max pooling, 1D lazy batch normalization,
    ReLU activation, and channel-wise normalization to produce a compact per-channel descriptor.

    Computation steps:
    1. Center each channel by subtracting its spatial mean.
    2. Apply 2D max pooling to reduce spatial dimensions.
    3. Flatten the spatial dimensions and apply LazyBatchNorm1d across channels.
    4. Apply ReLU non-linearity.
    5. Aggregate over the spatial dimension to get per-channel descriptors.
    6. L2-normalize the per-channel descriptors per sample.
