    Complex 3D upsampling block using ConvTranspose3d combined with channel gating and clamping.
    
    Computation steps:
    1. Apply a transposed 3D convolution to upsample the input spatially.
    2. Apply Hardswish activation element-wise.
    3. Compute a channel-wise descriptor by spatial global average, clamp it with Hardtanh,
       transform to a gating vector with sigmoid, and apply it to the activated features.
    4. Upsample the original input (trilinear) to match the transposed conv output and add it (residual).
