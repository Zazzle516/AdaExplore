    A moderately complex module that demonstrates a mixed 2D <-> 1D processing pattern:
      - Applies MaxPool2d (with indices) to reduce spatial resolution.
      - Flattens pooled spatial map into a sequence and applies LazyInstanceNorm1d + LazyConv1d
        to process spatial locations as a temporal sequence (per channel).
      - Restores the spatial layout and uses MaxUnpool2d (with the original indices) to
        reconstruct to the original resolution.
      - Uses a learned channel-wise scale and a residual connection to produce the final output.

    This pattern combines pooling/unpooling semantics with lazy initialization layers
    that set their shapes at first forward pass.
