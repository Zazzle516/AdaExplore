    Complex model that:
      - Applies a pointwise convolution to mix input channels.
      - Extracts overlapping patches using nn.Unfold.
      - Applies a learned linear transform to each patch (per-patch MLP).
      - Applies a Hardsigmoid nonlinearity to the transformed patches.
      - Reconstructs the feature map using nn.Fold.
      - Normalizes the reconstructed feature map with LazyInstanceNorm3d (requires 5D input).
      - Produces a single-channel spatial map by aggregating across channels.

    This combines convolution, unfold/fold patch processing, a learnable per-patch linear
    mapping, a lazy 3D instance normalization, and a Hardsigmoid activation.
