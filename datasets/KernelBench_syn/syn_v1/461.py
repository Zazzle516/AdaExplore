class Model(nn.Module):
    """
    A moderately complex 2D convolutional module that demonstrates the use of lazy initialization
    and max-unpooling to reconstruct spatial dimensions. The model performs the following steps:

    1. Lazy convolution to project input channels to a fixed number of feature maps.
    2. 1x1 reduction to halve the channel dimension and a ReLU + BatchNorm.
    3. Max pooling with indices (returns indices for unpooling).
    4. A small convolution on the pooled representation.
    5. Max unpooling using the stored indices to restore the pre-pooled spatial dimensions.
    6. A lazy 1x1 convolution on the original input to create a residual path.
    7. Channel-wise concatenation of unpooled features and residual, followed by a final conv.

    This combines nn.LazyConv2d and nn.MaxUnpool2d in a coherent forward pass.
