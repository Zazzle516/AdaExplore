    Complex module combining AdaptiveAvgPool3d, ReLU, and AvgPool1d with
    a small post-pooling channel-wise normalization.

    Computation pipeline:
      1. AdaptiveAvgPool3d reduces spatial dimensions to a target output size.
      2. ReLU activation is applied element-wise.
      3. The pooled 3D spatial dimensions are flattened into a 1D sequence per channel.
      4. AvgPool1d is applied across that sequence to aggregate local temporal information.
      5. Channel-wise normalization (mean/std) is performed across the resulting sequence.

    This produces a tensor of shape (batch_size, channels, pooled_length_after_avgpool1d).
