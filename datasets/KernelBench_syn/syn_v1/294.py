"""
Complex model combining an RNN encoder, a TransformerDecoder stack, and 3D instance normalization.
Processing pipeline:
 - RNN (encoder) consumes an input sequence.
 - A linear projector maps RNN outputs to the Transformer d_model and acts as memory.
 - A provided target embedding sequence (tgt) is decoded by nn.TransformerDecoder using the RNN memory.
 - The decoder outputs are pooled into a single vector per batch, projected into a 3D spatial tensor,
   normalized with nn.InstanceNorm3d, and finally reduced to class logits.

Structure matches provided examples:
 - Model class inheriting from nn.Module
 - get_inputs() returns runtime inputs
 - get_init_inputs() returns constructor arguments
 - Module-level configuration variables
