    A small 3D residual-like block that combines Conv3d, LazyBatchNorm3d, PReLU, and RReLU.
    
    The forward pass does:
      1. 3x3x3 Conv3d -> PReLU (channel-wise) -> LazyBatchNorm3d
      2. 1x1x1 Conv3d -> RReLU
      3. Residual add (with optional 1x1x1 projection if channels differ)
      4. Adaptive average pooling to a single spatial location and optional squeeze
    
    This demonstrates mixing normalization, parameterized activation, and randomized activation
    in a slightly more involved computation with multiple tensor shapes.
