    Complex model that combines 1D convolutional feature extraction with 3D instance
    normalization and cross-modal attention-style modulation.

    Architecture summary:
    - 1D branch (sequence input):
        LazyConv1d -> LazyBatchNorm1d -> ReLU -> AdaptiveAvgPool1d -> channel summary
        -> Linear projection -> sigmoid gating vector
    - 3D branch (volume input):
        LazyInstanceNorm3d -> gated modulation by the 1D-produced gating vector
        -> global spatial average
    - Output:
        Concatenation of sequence summary and modulated-volume summary per batch sample.

    The model uses lazy initializers for the in_channels / num_features of conv/bn/instance-norm
    so the channel sizes of inputs are determined at first forward pass.
