    """
    Complex 3D feature processing module that demonstrates a sequence of nonlinearities,
    adaptive pooling, channel mixing, gating, and a small residual-style combination.

    Computation pipeline (high level):
      - Apply randomized leaky ReLU (RReLU) to the input.
      - Adaptive average pool to a fixed 3D grid.
      - 1x1x1 convolution to mix channels.
      - LeakyReLU activation.
      - Flatten spatial dimensions and apply a learned gating (sigmoid of an FC).
      - Reshape gated features back to 3D and add a scaled residual of the activated conv output.
      - Global average over spatial dims to produce final per-channel outputs.

    This model uses nn.RReLU, nn.AdaptiveAvgPool3d, and nn.LeakyReLU as core layers.
