    Complex 1D feature modulation + channel mixing module.

    Pipeline:
    1. Apply Instance Normalization across (C, L) per instance.
    2. Aggregate temporal context via mean over length -> (B, C).
    3. Pass context through a small MLP (Linear -> ReLU6 -> Linear).
    4. Apply LogSigmoid to MLP output and exponentiate to recover a gating vector in (0,1).
    5. Gate the normalized features (channel-wise modulation).
    6. Apply a learned channel-mixing matrix to the gated features (mix channels at each time step).
    7. Combine mixed result with a learnable per-channel residual scale and final ReLU6 activation.

    This model demonstrates use of nn.InstanceNorm1d, nn.ReLU6, and nn.LogSigmoid,
    and performs non-trivial tensor manipulations (broadcasting, einsum-based channel mixing).
