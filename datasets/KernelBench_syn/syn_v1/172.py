    Complex 3D-to-2D processing module that:
    - Applies replication padding in 3D
    - Performs adaptive 3D average pooling
    - Aggregates depth dimension with mean and max branches
    - Concatenates the branches along channels and applies LazyInstanceNorm2d
    - Uses a 1x1 Conv2d to reduce channels and produces the final 2D feature map

    The module demonstrates combining nn.ReplicationPad3d, nn.AdaptiveAvgPool3d,
    and nn.LazyInstanceNorm2d into a single computation graph.
