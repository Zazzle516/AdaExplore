"""
Complex example combining LazyConvTranspose3d, ZeroPad2d and LazyBatchNorm2d.

Computation pattern:
1. 3D transposed convolution (learned) to upsample spatial dimensions.
2. Permute and collapse the depth dimension into the channel dimension to convert 3D output into a 2D feature map.
3. Zero-pad the 2D feature map.
4. Apply LazyBatchNorm2d (lazy initialization of num_features) to the padded 2D map.
5. Apply a non-linearity and a learned scalar affine transform (scale and bias).

Module-level configuration variables below describe input sizes and layer hyperparameters.
