"""
A more complex convolutional module that demonstrates a combination of Conv2d, GLU gating, and Mish activations.
Computation pattern:
    1. conv1: 3x3 convolution producing 2 * mid_channels so we can apply GLU along the channel dimension.
    2. GLU: split channels and gate to reduce to mid_channels.
    3. Mish activation.
    4. Depthwise convolution (groups=mid_channels) to mix spatial information per channel.
    5. Another Mish activation.
    6. Pointwise convolution (1x1) to project to out_channels.
    7. 1x1 skip projection from the input to out_channels and residual addition.
    8. Global average pooling to produce a (batch, out_channels) vector.

Module-level configuration variables control input/output shapes used by get_inputs.
