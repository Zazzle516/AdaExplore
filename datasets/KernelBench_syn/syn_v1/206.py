    Image-to-Image Transformer block that:
    - Uses PixelUnshuffle to split spatial resolution into channel patches
    - Projects patches into a transformer-friendly embedding space
    - Processes patches with a stack of TransformerEncoder layers
    - Applies AlphaDropout for regularization in embedding space
    - Projects back to patch channels and reconstructs the high-resolution image

    This module demonstrates a non-trivial combination of PixelUnshuffle, TransformerEncoder,
