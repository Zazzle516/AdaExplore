class Model(nn.Module):
    """
    A moderately complex 2D feature processing module that combines:
    - an initial convolutional projection
    - lazy instance normalization (num_features inferred on first forward)
    - ReLU non-linearity
    - 2D average pooling to reduce spatial resolution
    - adaptive average pooling to a fixed spatial output size
    - a 1x1 projection to the desired output channels
    - a skip path created from the original input (adaptive pooled and projected)
    - residual fusion and final activation

    This structure demonstrates mixing pooling layers (AvgPool2d, AdaptiveAvgPool2d)
    with a lazy normalization layer (LazyInstanceNorm2d) and simple convolutional
    projections. The LazyInstanceNorm2d will infer its number of features from the
    first forward pass, making initialization slightly deferred.
