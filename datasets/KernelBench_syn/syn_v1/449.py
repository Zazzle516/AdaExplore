class Model(nn.Module):
    """
    Complex 3D feature processing module that combines lazy batch normalization,
    3D average pooling, sigmoid gating and a learned channel mixing via matrix multiplication.

    Computation steps:
    1. Apply LazyBatchNorm3d to input (lazy init on first forward pass).
    2. Apply 3D average pooling to reduce spatial dimensions.
    3. Compute a channel-wise gate by global spatial average followed by a Sigmoid.
    4. Apply the gate to pooled features (channel-wise modulation).
    5. Aggregate spatial locations into channel descriptors and apply a channel mixing
       using an external projection matrix (provided as an input).
    6. L2-normalize the resulting channel vectors per sample.

    The model accepts an initialization parameter 'pool_kernel' which determines the
    AvgPool3d kernel/stride and 'eps' forwarded to LazyBatchNorm3d.
