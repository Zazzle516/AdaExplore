"""
Complex example combining LPPool2d, Softmax2d and Fold/Unfold patch processing.

Computation pipeline:
1. Project input channels -> mid_channels with 1x1 conv.
2. Apply LPPool2d to obtain a compact spatial attention map.
3. Softmax2d over channels at each spatial location to form channel-wise attention.
4. Upsample attention to the original spatial resolution and modulate projected feature map.
5. Extract overlapping patches with Unfold, perform a simple per-patch modulation,
   and reconstruct spatial map with Fold.
6. Reproject to original in_channels and add a residual connection to the input.
