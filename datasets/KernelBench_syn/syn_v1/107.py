    Complex module that extracts local patches with Unfold, computes
    patch-wise statistics to form attention weights, combines these with
    AvgPool2d summaries, applies a lazy BatchNorm2d, non-linearity,
    and upsamples back to the input resolution.

    Computation steps:
    1. avg = AvgPool2d(x) to produce a coarse spatial summary.
    2. patches = Unfold(x) to extract flattened sliding patches.
    3. Compute per-patch mean across the patch area and derive attention
       weights with softmax over spatial locations.
    4. Use the attention weights to compute a weighted summary of the
       pooled map, broadcast it back to the pooled spatial grid and add
       to the pooled map.
    5. Normalize with LazyBatchNorm2d, apply ReLU and upsample to the
       original resolution.
