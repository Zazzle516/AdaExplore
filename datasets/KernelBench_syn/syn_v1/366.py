    Complex 1D upsampling block that demonstrates a combined use of:
      - LazyConvTranspose1d (lazy initialization of in_channels),
      - SyncBatchNorm for synchronized normalization,
      - GLU gating non-linearity,
      - a small non-linear post-scaling and a second BatchNorm.

    The forward pass performs:
      1) A transposed convolution to increase temporal resolution and produce 2*C channels
      2) A SyncBatchNorm over the produced channels
      3) A GLU gate that splits channels in half and gates them (reducing to C channels)
      4) A tanh non-linearity followed by a learned scalar scaling
      5) A final SyncBatchNorm for stabilized outputs

    This produces an upsampled and gated feature map suitable as a decoder/residual building block.
