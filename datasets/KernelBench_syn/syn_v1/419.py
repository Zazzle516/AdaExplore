    A moderately complex 1D signal processing module that:
      1. Zero-pads the input signal.
      2. Applies a transposed convolution (LazyConvTranspose1d) to expand temporal resolution.
      3. Applies a non-linearity (GELU).
      4. Applies Local Response Normalization across channels.
      5. Projects channel features to a per-timestep embedding via a linear layer.
      6. L2-normalizes the final per-timestep embeddings.

      - LazyConvTranspose1d allows the module to be instantiated without specifying in_channels;
        it will be inferred at first forward pass.
      - Input expected shape: (batch, in_channels, length)
      - Output shape: (batch, out_length, embed_dim) -- time dimension moved to axis 1
