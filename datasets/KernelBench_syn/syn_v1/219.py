    Complex module that transforms a 1D sequence into a 2D feature map, applies instance normalization,
    nonlinearities and spatial pooling, then fuses global statistics from the original sequence and
    pooled features to produce a compact output vector.

    Computation steps:
    1. 1D convolution over the input sequence to produce channel-wise features.
    2. InstanceNorm1d over the conv output and Softsign activation.
    3. Reshape the sequence into a 2D feature map (H x W).
    4. MaxPool2d spatial pooling over the 2D map.
    5. Global averaging of pooled spatial features and global averaging of the original sequence.
    6. Concatenate these statistics and apply a final linear layer followed by Softsign.
