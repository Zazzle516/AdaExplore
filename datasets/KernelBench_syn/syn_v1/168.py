"""
Complex PyTorch module combining LazyInstanceNorm2d, Mish activation, and Softmax2d.
The model:
 - Normalizes the input feature map with LazyInstanceNorm2d (lazy channel inference).
 - Applies Mish non-linearity.
 - Computes a per-pixel attention distribution across channels with Softmax2d.
 - Builds a spatial context by weighting activated features with that attention and summing across channels.
 - Produces a spatial gating map from the context and re-scales the activated features.
 - Adds a residual connection and returns a global pooled embedding (per-channel) as output.

Module-level configuration variables define the shapes for input generation.
