    Complex module that combines AdaptiveMaxPool2d, InstanceNorm1d and GLU with a linear
    projection. The model:
      1. Applies adaptive max pooling to reduce spatial dimensions.
      2. Treats the pooled spatial grid as a sequence and normalizes channels with InstanceNorm1d.
      3. Projects per-step channel features to twice the channel dimensionality.
      4. Uses GLU to gate and reduce back to channel dimensionality.
      5. Aggregates the sequence (mean) to produce a per-batch feature vector.
