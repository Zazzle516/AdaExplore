Complex model combining LazyBatchNorm2d, Hardswish, and MultiheadAttention.

Pattern:
- Input image tensor (B, C, H, W)
- LazyBatchNorm2d followed by Hardswish
- Patch extraction via unfold -> sequence of patch tokens
- Linear projection to embedding dimension
- Multihead self-attention over spatial tokens (batch_first=True)
- Simple feed-forward residual block
- Project tokens back to patch pixels and reconstruct image
- Final Hardswish activation
