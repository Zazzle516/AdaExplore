"""
Complex 3D processing module combining Conv3d, GroupNorm, Tanhshrink activation,
Dropout3d, AlphaDropout and two projection heads with a global pooling + residual fusion.

Structure:
- Model(nn.Module)
  - __init__ takes architecture hyperparameters
  - forward runs the computation pipeline described below

Computation pipeline (forward):
1. conv3d -> groupnorm
2. element-wise Tanhshrink nonlinearity
3. channel-wise dropout (Dropout3d)
4. global average pooling to (B, C_mid)
5. alpha dropout on pooled features
6. two projection heads:
   - main head: maps pooled mid-channels -> out_features
   - skip head: pools original input channels and maps -> out_features
7. fuse heads (sum), apply a final scaling (sigmoid) and return
