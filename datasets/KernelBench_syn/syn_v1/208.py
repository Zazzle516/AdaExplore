    A moderately complex vision-style module that demonstrates a sequence of:
      - 1x1 convolution to project input channels
      - Lp pooling to aggregate local neighborhoods
      - a 3x3 convolution for local mixing
      - Tanh non-linearity
      - FeatureAlphaDropout for channel-wise stochastic regularization
      - global spatial pooling and a final linear layer for output logits

    This combines nn.LPPool2d, nn.Tanh, and nn.FeatureAlphaDropout in a small pipeline.
