"""
Complex 3D convolutional module combining ConstantPad3d, Conv3d and Softmax.

Computation pattern:
- ConstantPad3d to ensure controlled boundary behavior.
- Initial Conv3d (with external padding) to produce mid-level feature maps.
- Depthwise Conv3d for channel-wise spatial processing.
- Softmax applied over flattened spatial dimensions per channel to generate
  spatial attention-like weights.
- Reweighting of the features by the softmax maps, residual addition, and
  final 1x1x1 Conv3d projection to produce the output channels.
