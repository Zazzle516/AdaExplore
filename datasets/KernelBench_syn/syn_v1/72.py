    """
    A 3D feature processing module that demonstrates a non-trivial interplay between
    ConvTranspose3d, MaxPool3d / MaxUnpool3d (with indices), and a Tanhshrink activation.

    Computation pattern:
      1. ConvTranspose3d to produce intermediate feature maps (keeps spatial dims).
      2. MaxPool3d (with indices) to downsample and collect pooling indices.
      3. Another ConvTranspose3d (1x1x1) to transform pooled features.
      4. MaxUnpool3d with the stored indices to restore spatial resolution.
      5. Residual addition with the pre-pooled features.
      6. Tanhshrink non-linearity and spatial aggregation to produce a compact output.

    The module returns a (batch_size, mid_channels) tensor by spatially averaging the
    activated feature maps after the unpool+residual stage.
