    A 3D residual block that combines convolutional transforms with lazy instance normalization
    and multiple nonlinearities. The module demonstrates:
      - A 3D convolution to increase feature dimensionality
      - LazyInstanceNorm3d to lazily infer num_features from the incoming tensor
      - PReLU activation (channel-wise)
      - A 1x1 projection for the residual path
      - Softsign on the residual branch and an element-wise residual addition

    The design ensures the normalization layer is initialized lazily from the first forward pass.
