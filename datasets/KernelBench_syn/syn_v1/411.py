    """
    A moderately complex 3D vision-style model combining Conv3d, LocalResponseNorm and LazyConv3d.
    The model performs an initial 3D convolution to project input channels, applies ReLU and local
    response normalization, then uses a lazily-initialized 3D convolution to produce an output
    channel projection. Spatial dimensions are aggregated with AdaptiveAvgPool3d and the result
    is passed through a fully-connected layer producing a compact feature vector.
