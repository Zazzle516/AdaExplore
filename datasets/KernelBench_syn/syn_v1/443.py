    Complex model that fuses 3D adaptive pooling with 2D convolution and a channel-wise Softmax gating.

    Computation steps:
    1. AdaptiveAvgPool3d to reduce (D, H, W) to (pool_d, pool_h, pool_w).
    2. Fuse depth into channels by reshaping (B, C, pool_d, pool_h, pool_w) -> (B, C * pool_d, pool_h, pool_w).
    3. Apply a 2D convolution over the fused representation.
    4. Compute a global channel descriptor by spatially averaging the convolution output.
    5. Apply Softmax across channels to produce gating weights.
    6. Re-scale the convolution feature maps by the per-channel gating weights and return the modulated feature maps.
