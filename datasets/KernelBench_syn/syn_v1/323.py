    A composite module that demonstrates a multi-stage spatial reduction and gating pipeline:
      1. 3D average pooling to reduce depth/height/width.
      2. Per-sample per-channel L2 normalization across spatial dims.
      3. Collapse depth into the channel dimension and apply an Lp (2-norm) 2D pooling.
      4. Create a channel-wise gate from pooled feature statistics via LogSigmoid and apply multiplicative gating.
      5. Restore original channel/depth split, aggregate across depth, and final L2 normalization.

    This model intentionally mixes nn.AvgPool3d, nn.LPPool2d and nn.LogSigmoid with tensor reshapes and norms
    to create a nontrivial computation graph while following PyTorch best practices.
