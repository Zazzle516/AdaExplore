    """
    Complex module combining 3D max-pooling, spatial-channel reshaping,
    adaptive average pooling, spatial softmax, and cross-tensor attention-like
    contraction followed by a learned projection and final matmul.

    Forward computation (high-level):
        1. MaxPool3d on A to reduce spatial resolution.
        2. Collapse the depth dimension into channels -> treat depth as extra channels.
        3. AdaptiveAvgPool2d to fixed spatial resolution (ADAPT_H x ADAPT_W).
        4. Apply Softmax2d across channels at each spatial location.
        5. AdaptiveAvgPool2d on B to same spatial resolution.
        6. Compute cross-correlation via einsum over spatial dims:
               T[b, c_collapsed, k] = sum_{p,q} S[b,c_collapsed,p,q] * B_pooled[b,k,p,q]
        7. Apply a learnable linear projection over the k dimension to produce features.
        8. Average over collapsed channels and final matmul with external matrix M.

    Inputs:
        A: torch.Tensor of shape (B, C1, D, H, W)
        B: torch.Tensor of shape (B, C2, H, W)
        M: torch.Tensor of shape (PROJ_OUT, FINAL_OUT)  # external projection matrix

    Output:
        torch.Tensor of shape (B, FINAL_OUT)
