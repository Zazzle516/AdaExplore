    Complex reconstruction model that:
    - Extracts non-overlapping image patches using nn.Unfold
    - Projects patches into an embedding space
    - Uses a stack of TransformerDecoder layers (nn.TransformerDecoder)

    - Reconstructs image patches and folds them back to the image space

    The model demonstrates combining convolution-like patch extraction with
    transformer decoder layers to perform conditional patch-wise processing.
