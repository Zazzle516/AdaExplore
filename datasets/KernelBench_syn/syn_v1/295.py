    """
    Complex model that combines BatchNorm2d, MaxPool2d, RMSNorm, and a small
    channel-wise gating MLP. The computation flow is:
      1. BatchNorm2d over channels
      2. Spatial downsampling with MaxPool2d
      3. RMSNorm applied across the channel dimension for each spatial location
      4. Global spatial average to produce a channel descriptor
      5. Two-layer MLP (Linear -> SiLU -> Linear) to compute a sigmoid gating per channel
      6. Channel-wise gating applied and upsampling back to original spatial dimensions
      7. Residual add with the original input (if spatial sizes match)
    This pattern uses both channel-wise normalization (RMSNorm) and batch normalization,
    mixes local (per-pixel) and global (spatial average) information, and includes a small
    learned bottleneck for gating.
