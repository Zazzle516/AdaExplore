    A composite model that:
    - Applies a LazyConv1d to a 3-channel sequence input (lazy in_channels inferred at first forward)
    - Reshapes the conv output into a 2D feature map (treating sequence length as H*W)
    - Applies AdaptiveAvgPool2d to reduce spatial resolution
    - Flattens and projects pooled features to an embedding dimension
    - Adds a residual projection obtained by global-average-pooling the conv sequence features
    - Uses GELU activation before returning the final embedding

    The model demonstrates mixing 1D convolution, 2D pooling, nonlinear activation, and
    both spatial and channel-wise aggregation patterns.
