    Sequence feature compressor and reconstructer.

    This module:
    - Performs adaptive 1D average pooling across the temporal dimension to compress sequence length.
    - Applies a two-layer pointwise MLP (Linear -> Tanhshrink -> Linear) on pooled features.
    - Upsamples the processed features back to the original sequence length using linear interpolation.
    - Adds a residual connection from the original input and applies a final Tanhshrink.
