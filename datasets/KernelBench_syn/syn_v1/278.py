    """
    Image-to-vector model that:
    - Projects spatial features into a token sequence via a 1x1 convolution.
    - Adds a small learnable positional embedding broadcasted across tokens.
    - Applies MultiheadAttention over the spatial token sequence (self-attention).
    - Uses a residual connection followed by Softplus activation.
    - Reprojects tokens back to a spatial map and applies MaxPool2d.
    - Produces a final vector per-batch by global-average-pooling the pooled feature map.

    This combines convolutional projection, transformer-style attention, non-linear activation,
    and pooling to create a heterogeneous computation pattern.
