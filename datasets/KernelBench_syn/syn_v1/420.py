    Complex 2D feature transform that combines PReLU activation, 1x1 channel expansion,
    spatial MaxPool branch, RReLU branch, upsampling, concatenation, and a final conv
    with residual connection.

    Computation steps (high-level):
      1. Apply channel-wise PReLU to input.
      2. Expand channels with a 1x1 convolution.
      3. Split expanded tensor into two channel-halves.
      4. Branch A: MaxPool2d spatially reduces features, then upsample back.
      5. Branch B: Apply randomized leaky activation (RReLU).
      6. Concatenate branches along channel dim and fuse with a 3x3 convolution.
      7. Add residual connection and return output.
