    Complex model that combines 1D Lp pooling, Conv1d projections, a TransformerDecoderLayer,

      2) Two 1x1 Conv1d projections to produce 'tgt' and 'memory' embeddings for the transformer decoder.
      3) TransformerDecoderLayer to allow cross-attention between pooled target sequence and full-resolution memory.
      4) Reshape decoder output into a 2D spatial layout and apply MaxPool2d.
