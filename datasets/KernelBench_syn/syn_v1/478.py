"""
Complex PyTorch kernel module that:
- Applies a spatial Softmax2d across channel dimension for each depth slice.
- Produces weighted features by elementwise multiplication.
- Performs a 3D max-pooling (with indices) and a corresponding MaxUnpool3d.
- Uses an AvgPool3d layer (kernel_size=1) to demonstrate incorporation of the layer API.
- Adds a residual connection and reduces to per-channel descriptors via global mean.

Module-level configuration variables control tensor shapes to ensure compatibility.
