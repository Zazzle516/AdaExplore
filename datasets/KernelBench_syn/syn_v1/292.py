class Model(nn.Module):
    """
    Complex 3D feature gating module combining LazyBatchNorm3d, Softplus activation,
    and AlphaDropout to compute an input-dependent channel gating and residual fusion.

    Computation steps:
      1. Apply Lazy BatchNorm3d to stabilize channel statistics.
      2. Global-spatial average to produce channel descriptors.
      3. Two-layer channel projection (fc -> Softplus -> AlphaDropout -> fc) to produce gates.
      4. Sigmoid gating applied per-channel and broadcasted over spatial dims.
      5. Residual fusion between gated-normalized features and a scaled original input.
      6. Final Softplus nonlinearity to produce output.

    Inputs:
      x: Tensor of shape (batch_size, in_channels, depth, height, width)

    Returns:
      Tensor of same shape as input with per-channel modulation applied.
