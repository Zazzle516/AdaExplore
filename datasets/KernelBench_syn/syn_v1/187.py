    A more complex 1D sequence module that demonstrates a small upsampling encoder
    followed by channel projection and adaptive pooling to a fixed temporal size.

    Architecture:
    - ConvTranspose1d upsampling (deconv1) to expand temporal resolution by `up_scale`
    - GELU activation
    - ConvTranspose1d refinement (deconv2) with kernel_size=3 to mix neighborhoods
    - AdaptiveMaxPool1d to a fixed output length (pool_size)
    - A projected skip connection: pool the original input to pool_size then apply
      a 1x1 ConvTranspose1d (proj) to match output channels
    - Residual add, LayerNorm across channels (applied on permuted tensor),
      and a learned per-channel gating via sigmoid-scaled parameter
