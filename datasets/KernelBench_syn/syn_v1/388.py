    Complex hybrid 2D/1D module that:
      - Applies a strided 2D convolution to downsample spatial resolution by 2
      - Applies a second 2D convolution + ReLU to extract features
      - Treats the width dimension as a sequence and upsamples it using ConvTranspose1d
      - Restores spatial layout and upsamples the height by integer repetition to recover original size
      - Applies a final 1x1 convolution to project to the desired output channels and a final ReLU

    This demonstrates a mixed use of nn.Conv2d, nn.ConvTranspose1d and nn.ReLU,
    together with careful tensor reshaping/permutes.
