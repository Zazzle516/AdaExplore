class Model(nn.Module):
    """
    1D temporal processing block that combines Zero padding, Lp pooling,
    Alpha Dropout, pointwise projection, a Swish-like activation, and a
    residual path with LayerNorm.

    Forward computation:
        1. Zero-pad the input along the temporal dimension.
        2. Apply Lp pooling (LPPool1d) to aggregate local neighborhoods.
        3. Apply AlphaDropout for regularization.
        4. Project channel dimension with a 1x1 Conv1d.
        5. Apply Swish activation (x * sigmoid(x)).
        6. Create a residual by adaptive-averaging the original (unpadded)
           input to the pooled temporal length and projecting to out_features.
        7. Sum projection + residual and apply LayerNorm across channels.

    Input:
        x: Tensor of shape (batch_size, in_channels, length)

    Output:
        Tensor of shape (batch_size, out_features, pooled_length)
