    """
    Complex 3D feature processing block that combines Instance Normalization,
    SELU activation, channel-wise learned gating, and Feature Alpha Dropout,
    with a scaled residual connection.

    Computation pipeline:
      1. InstanceNorm3d normalization across spatial dims per-instance.
      2. SELU activation for self-normalizing non-linearity.
      3. Compute per-channel spatial means and apply a learned channel-wise
         affine transform followed by a sigmoid to produce a gating map.
      4. Multiply the activated features by the gating map (per-sample, per-channel).
      5. Apply FeatureAlphaDropout to mask entire channels probabilistically.
      6. Add a scaled residual connection from the input, with a learnable
         per-channel scaling factor.

    This module is designed to operate on 5D tensors with shape
    (batch, channels, depth, height, width).
