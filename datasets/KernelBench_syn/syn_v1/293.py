"""
Complex PyTorch module that combines 3D pooling/unpooling, a lazy 2D convolution applied slice-wise,
and a Transformer decoder layer to perform cross-slice contextual refinement.

Computation overview:
1. MaxPool3d over spatial dims (H, W) with return_indices to keep positions for unpooling.
2. Reshape pooled volume to treat each depth slice as an independent 2D image and apply LazyConv2d.
3. Global-average each slice to form a sequence of embeddings (depth dimension is the sequence).
4. Use a TransformerDecoderLayer to let slices attend to each other (contextual refinement).
5. Decode transformer outputs back to spatial maps via a Linear layer, reshape to match pooled spatial
   resolution and use MaxUnpool3d with stored indices to reconstruct original spatial resolution.
6. Add a residual connection to the original input.

Module-level configuration variables control dimensions and pooling behavior.
