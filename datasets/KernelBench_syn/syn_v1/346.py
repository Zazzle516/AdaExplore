    """
    Complex module that demonstrates combining circular 2D padding, 1D average pooling,
    Mish activation, sequence modulation, and a learned linear projection.

    Input:
        images: Tensor of shape (N, C, H, W)
        context: Tensor of shape (N, L_pooled) where L_pooled is computed from H, W, PAD, POOL_KERNEL, POOL_STRIDE

    Computation steps:
        1. Circular 2D padding to preserve wrap-around spatial context.
        2. Collapse spatial dims (H_padded, W_padded) into a single sequence dimension L.
        3. Apply AvgPool1d over the sequence to downsample (kernel + stride).
        4. Apply Mish nonlinearity.
        5. Modulate sequence tokens by per-position context weights (element-wise).
        6. Linearly project the channel dimension to OUT_FEATURES via a learned matrix.
        7. Global-average pool over sequence length to produce (N, OUT_FEATURES).
